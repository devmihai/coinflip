Coin Flip App!

This project provided an opportunity to showcase my CSS and JavaScript skills. To develop this app, I used two pictures, rotated them with CSS, and then manipulated them with JavaScript. Also, check the buttons, and let me know if you liked them!

At the moment, the app is only counting how many times someone flipped heads/tails, but for the future, I am working on implementing some more features, so make sure you stay tuned!
