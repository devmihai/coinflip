Coin Flip App!

The idea of this app came one day when I had to make a decision and wanted to flip a coin to make up my mind (very mature, right?). The problem was that at that moment, I had none left in my pocket. So, I thought for a second, why not have an app for this kind of "problem"?

To develop this app, I used two pictures(of a Romanian coin), rotated them with CSS, and achieved the final result by using JavaScript. Also, check the buttons, and let me know if you liked them!

At the moment, the app is only counting how many times someone flipped heads/tails, but for the future, I am working on implementing some more features, so make sure you stay tuned!

Hope you enjoy it as much as I enjoyed developing it!
